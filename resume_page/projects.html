			<div class="column"><h2>Valkenkrig: The End of Days</h2>
			<p>A D&D Campaign I wrote a few years ago that had dozens of my friends frothing at the mouth for more. Said campaign has homebrew rules I wrote myself for everything from Lycanthropy, to firearms and an entire cast of totally original creatures and characters. It has a similar level of complexity to something like Game of Thrones, or The Lord of the Rings.</p></div>

			<div class="column"><h2>The Recommended Routine</h2>
			<p>About 10 months ago I began doing a workout based on gymnastics. The core facet of progress measurement is your ability to perform handstands. I went from barely being able to stand with the help of a wall, to now challenging myself to consistently hold a handstand for five to ten seconds.</p></div>

			<div class="column"><h2>Rap God</h2>
			<p>As a test of mental acuity, I attempted to memorize Eminem's song "Rap God". It holds the world record for the most words in a single song that is 6 minutes long, uttered at a staggering 4.28 words per second. Yes, I know every word. Yes, I can do it fast. Yes, I can prove it.</p></div>
