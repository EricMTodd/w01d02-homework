		<h3>I am he who dares, and he who dares wins.</h3>
	<p>I am Eric Todd. I was born in Utah as an only child whose parents divorced at my first birthday. I have always been open minded and a seeker of truth. At the end of the day, all I have is my work ethic and the rapport I build with others. Come, join me in greatness.</p>
